# Game Client (Godot)

This directory is reserved for the Godot project that ships the Jet Raiders
client. The current Godot project lives under `client/`, but the target
architecture keeps the game client isolated here so future multi-service
layouts are clearer.

## Architecture Guidelines

Follow `CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md` when adding service-style modules or
shared client services.
